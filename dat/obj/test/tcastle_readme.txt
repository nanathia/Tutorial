Tsuyama castle(parts)

Usage:
This archive includes both 3DS and OBJ format model.
 Import model to your 3D application, don't check the "position" and "size".
If you want to combine the castle parts, it is important.
For Poser user, I recommend the OBJ format model. But beccause it's very large scale model, you'll find it's bit difficult to move the camera.
*_b.jpg file is bump map, apply it if necessary.
Note:
 This IS a low polygon model, so please don't render it within a short distance:-). I know it needs more high quality texture map, too.
